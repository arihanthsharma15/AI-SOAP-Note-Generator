Doctor: Good morning, Mrs. Gupta. What seems to be the problem today?
Patient: Doctor, my eyes are giving me a lot of trouble. It feels like there's sand in them. This morning, I could barely open them. I was perfectly fine when I went to sleep last night.
Doctor: I see. Do you wear contact lenses?
Patient: No, never have. And I've never had this happen before.
Doctor: Any idea what might have caused it? Any recent changes?
Patient: Well, yesterday afternoon I was doing some gardening. I was walking my dogs and pulling out some dead leaves from the plants in my balcony. Maybe some dust got in? I do have a history of allergies.
Doctor: That's a very important clue. Let's talk about your general health. Any blurred vision?
Patient: No, vision is clear.
Doctor: Okay. And your diabetes? You mentioned you were managing it with diet.
Patient: Yes, I'm trying to avoid carbs and sugars. I haven't been checking my blood sugar regularly, though.
Doctor: We should keep an eye on that. Now, let me have a look. (Doctor performs examination). Okay, your pulse is 76 and blood pressure is 128/78, all good. Temperature is normal at 98.6. Your eyes are definitely red. The rest of the examination seems normal - ears, nose, throat are clear. Lungs are clear. Heart has a regular rhythm. No swelling in your arms or legs.
Doctor: Based on the gardening you did and your history of allergies, this looks like a classic case of Allergic Conjunctivitis. That's what's causing the "sand in the eyes" feeling. Regarding your diabetes, since you're not having any complications, we'll note it as Type 2 Diabetes without complications.
Patient: So what should I do for my eyes?
Doctor: I'll prescribe some eye drops called Tobradex. They should help with the irritation. Please try not to touch or rub your eyes. And be mindful of dust and pollen. For your diabetes, let's continue with the dietary changes. Focus on reducing starchy foods like rice and pasta. It would be a good idea to start monitoring your blood sugar again.
